# Hey, I'm Aawesome

### Background

The main programming languages I have spent a lot of time on are **javascript**, **java**, **lua**, and if html and css count, then that.

I can also make games in Godot, Unity, Roblox, and Construct 3.
I've dabbled in C#, GDScript, Swift, Python, and many others, but my strongsuit is definately definitely, and second is java.
