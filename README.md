# Hey, I'm Aawesome
## A coder that loves iced coffee (normal tastes like garbage)

### Background

I've been coding for many, MANY years in 30+ coding languages. However, while I am a jack of (half of them) trades, there
are a few languages that I am extremely fluent in.

### Skills

too lazy, i'll do it in a bit :D
