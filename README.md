```js
local Aawesome = require('aawesome')
Aawesome.Send("Iced Coffee")
Aawesome.Code()
```

# Hey, I'm Aawesome
## A coder that loves iced coffee (normal tastes like garbage)

### Background

The main programming languages I have spent a lot of time on are **javascript**, **python**, and if html and css count, then that.

I've dabbled in C#, Java, Swift, mySQL, and many others, but my strongsuit is definately javascript, and second is python.
